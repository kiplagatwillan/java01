# Proj05 - ITSE 2321 Object-Oriented Programming

## Project Overview
This project, **Proj05**, is designed to demonstrate the use of `String` and `StringBuffer` classes in Java and to reinforce the concept of object reference comparison using the `==` operator. The main goals are to:
- Generate and manipulate random byte values.
- Embed values in strings with certification text.
- Compare string references.
- Append names to objects and verify object identity using `StringBuffer`.

## Files
- **Proj05.java**: This file contains the main driver code and should **not** be modified.
- **Proj05Runner.java**: This file is where the required methods `runA` and `runB` are implemented according to project specifications.

## Requirements
- **Java Version**: Ensure that your Java environment meets the version requirements specified in the course syllabus.
- **Command-line Arguments**: For consistent results in random value generation, provide an integer argument when running the program (e.g., `java Proj05 5`).

## Project Specifications
The program outputs a certification string including a randomly generated byte value and appends the student's name (in this case, Brian Rotich) to the output. The output format and requirements are fully specified in the project guidelines.

Example output:
